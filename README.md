Project developed with node v8.11.3

It consists of a contact us, which is validated. Once the information has been entered, you can go to the info tab to see the existing information. And you have the option to filter by name all the contact us objects

To install it open a console and run the command "npm install". Once installed run the "npm start" command, which will start the JSON-Server on port 3000, and the application on port 8080 of localhost.

The project is responsive, when the screen is made smaller the tabs will change places, also in the info part the information is adapted to the screen.
For the grid I used the Skeleton css library and my own definitions.
